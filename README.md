# PI Tuning
Collection of simple simulation, tuning, fitting, and plotting tools to design and tune a 
delay + integrator thermal process.

See my blog post [Tuning PI Controllers for Thermoelectric Coolers](https://maskset.net/blog/2025/06/12/tuning-pi-controllers-for-thermoelectric-coolers/) for more of a description.

## Features
+ SIMC Tuning Tools
+ Delay + Integrator fitting model parameters from a step response
+ Delay + Integrator plant model for simulation
+ PI Filter
+ Analysis & plotting notebook
